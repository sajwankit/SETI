* compressing image results in loss of positive needles..
need to a way to either preserve the positive needles in the compressed image, or:
read orig image chunkwise, run model on the chunks

cut image along frequency axis, rearrange tiles





CNN training:
observe positive classes
mechanism to identify lines in image
attention
contrast augment
identifying rsi
spectrogram ift?
FIND NEEDLE, THEN PLACE IT TO DIFFERENT LOCATION TO GENERATE MORE SAMPLE
specaugment
doppler effect

1. SHOW FALSE POSITIVE, TRUE POSITIVE, WHICH IMAGE CLASSIFIED AS FP
2. USE IMAGE SHAPED AS BY KAGGLERS
